</p><blockquote><em>Abstract.</em> We present some mathematical ideas that occur in art and computer
graphics. We touch upon the geometry of similar triangles, rigid motions in three space,
perspective transformations, and projective geometry. We discuss computations behind rendering
objects in perspective. We then describe vanishing points, answer how to measure distance in a
receding direction in a perspective drawing and why a circle in three space becomes an ellipse when
drawn in perspective. We use MAPLE generated computations and graphics to illustrate the ideas.

<p>Artists now make amazing images using computers (<i>e.g.,</i> visit <a href="http://www.pixar.com/">PIXAR.</a>). But taking into account the complexity of all the
physical laws of light requires extensive computation. We'll focus on mathematical concepts and
derive the basic formulas that are at the heart of all rendering machines. We shall concentrate on
the geometry of drawing objects, which can be described by points in space. We'll calculate the
perspective transformations that locate the points on the drawing. Then we'll use MAPLE's
capability to draw polygons and lines to show the effect of transformation. We'll apply this to
show some mathematical / artistic concepts. (This note is a slightly expanded version of lecture
notes [TA].) 
</p><p>

</p><p>A mathematical theory of perspective drawing could only be developed when the Renaissance freed
painters to depict nature in a way closer to what they observed [IW]. The biographer Vasari
(1511-74) says that the Florentine architect Filipo Brunelleschi (1337-1446) studied Greek
geometry, developed a theory of perspective and undertook painting just to apply his geometry [KM].
The first treatise, <i>Della pittura</i>(1435) by Leone Battista Alberti (1404-72) furnished most
of the rules. Our diagram of <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm#PerspCirc">the perspective view of the circle</a> occurs in
his text. A complete mathematical treatment <i>De prospectiva pingendi</i> (1478) was given by the
Italian fresco painter Piero della Francesca (1410-1492). Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)
incorporated geometry in his painting and wrote a now lost text on perspective <i>Tratto della
pittura.</i> Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) also wrote a text on the practice of geometry
<i>Underweysung der Messung mid dem Zyrkel und Rychtscheyd</i> (1525) which was important in
passing on to the Germans the Italian knowledge of perspective drawing. In it,
 Dürer invented several 
<a href="http://search.famsf.org/4d.acgi$Record?53687&=list&=11&=&=And&=18&=0&=keywords&=Yes&=durer%20&=&=&=Yes&=&=f">drawing machines</a>  to teach perspective. Alberti was first to ask if
two drawing screens are interposed between the viewer and the object, and the object is projected
onto both resulting in two different pictures of the same scene, what properties do the two
pictures have in common [BC].

</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER">Alberti's Problem: What do the two projections have in common?
</p><p>

</p><p>This question prompted the development of a new subject, <i>projective geometry</i> whose
exponent was Girard Desargues (1591-1661). Desargues studied perspective geometry from a synthetic
point of view, meaning he built up the geometry from axioms about points, lines and planes. A
sampling is given in the section on <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm#ProjGeom">projective geometry.</a> There we address
the question why the perspective image of a circle necessarily the ellipse. It can also be answered
using analytic geometry methods, such as in our chapter on <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm#circle">analytic geometry,</a>
where first, points and lines are reduced to equations. A modern deductive footing for perspective
drawing was given later by Brook Taylor (1685-1731) and J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Lambert (1728-77). A
competing point of view has held by mathematicians such as René Decartes (1596-1650), Pierre
de Fermat (1601-1665) and Julius Plücker (1801-1868) who studied these question algebraically.
Their work spurred the development of <i>algebraic geometry.</i> Mathematical issues and history
are more completely covered in [BP], [DH], [FP], [M], [OW], [PD], [SD] and [WC]. 
</p><p>

</p><p>Some current popular drawing texts such as Edwards' [EB] de-emphasize the analytical approach in
favor of an intuitive sighting method for perspective. However, complicated drawing situations
require more analysis [EB], [EM]. If a student wishes to pursue linear perspective in the history
and art see, <i>e.g.</i> [CA]. There are a number of web sites worth perusing, [DJ], [EM], [MS] as
are sites discussing perspective and the internet [KJ], [XX]. The computer science of graphics is
discussed in [BP], [FP], [PP]. Many of our illustrations were generated by the <a href="http://www.mapleapps.com/categories/graphics/gallery/acgraphicsgallery.html">MAPLE</a> symbolic
algebra, graphics and computation system. Our code in the MAPLE programming language is available
at <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/HS.html"><tt>http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/HS.html</tt></a>
Differential geometric graphic applications of MAPLE are described in Oprea [OJ] and Rovenski [RV]
and of MATHEMATICA in Gray [GA]. Other graphics packages to render differential geometric objects, <i>e.g.,</i> are

<p>The perspective transformations that describe how a point in three space is mapped to the
drawing plane can be simply explained using elementary geometry. We begin by setting up
coordinates. A projection involves two coordinate systems. A point in the coordinate system of an
object to be drawn is given by <var>X=(x,y,z)</var> and the corresponding in the imaging system (on
the drawing plane) is <var>P=(u,v)</var>. If we use the standard right handed

</p><p>

</p><p>system, then <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> correspond to width and depth and <var>z</var>
corresponds to height. On the drawing plane, we let <var>u</var> be the horizontal variable and
<var>v</var> the vertical. 
</p><p>

</p><p>We can measure the distances between pairs of points in the usual way using the Euclidean
metric. If
<br> <var>X<sub>1</sub> = (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>)</var> and
<var>P<sub>1</sub> = (u<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>)</var> and so on, then 
</p><div class="style1">
<var>dist(X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>) = {(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> +
(y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (z<sub>1</sub> - 
z<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup>,<br>
<br>
dist(P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>) = {(u<sub>1</sub> - u<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 
(v<sub>1</sub> - v<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup></var>
</div>
<p> 
The projection from <var>X</var> to <var>P</var> is called a <i>parallel
projection</i> if all sets of parallel lines in the object are mapped to parallel lines on the
drawing. Such a mapping is given by an affine transformation, which is of the form 
</p><p align="CENTER">
<var> = f(X) = T + AX </var>
</p><p> 
</p><p>where <var>T</var> is a fixed vector in the plane
and <var>A</var> is a <var>3 x 2</var> constant matrix. Parallel projection has the
further property that ratios are preserved. That is if <var>X<sub>1</sub></var>,
<var>X<sub>2</sub></var>, <var>X<sub>3</sub></var> and <var>X<sub>4</sub></var> are collinear
points in the object, then the ratio of distances is preserved under parallel projection 
</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Mathematics of Perspective Drawing_files/p4.gif" align="MIDDLE" width="248" height="43" alt="Equation: f preserves ratio of distances">
</p><p>

</p><p>Of course denominators are assumed to be nonzero. 
</p><p>

</p><p>To illustrate, let's begin with an object in three space, say a simplified house. It consists of
the points <var>[0,0,0]</var>, <var>[0,0,3]</var>, <var>[3.5,0,5]</var>, <var>[7,0,3]</var>,
<var>[7,0,0]</var>, <var>[0,9,3]</var>, <var>[0,9,0]</var>, <var>[7,9,3]</var>, <var>[7,9,0]</var>,
<var>[3.5,9,5]</var> which define eight corners of a box and two gable points and
<var>[3,9.1,0]</var>, <var>[5,9.1,0]</var>, <var>[5,9.1,8]</var>, <var>[3,9.1,8]</var>,
<var>[3,10.2,0]</var>, <var>[5,10.2,0]</var>, <var>[5,10.2,8]</var>, <var>[5,10.2,8]</var> which
define the chimney.

</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER">MAPLE generated <var>3d</var> plot of house.
</p><p>

</p><p>The most frequent parallel projections are called <i>elevations</i>, <i>oblique projections</i>
and <i>isometric projections.</i> The elevations are just the front, top and side views of the
object. Thus the projections are given by the functions 
</p><p> 
</p><p align="CENTER">
<var>F<sub>front</sub>(x,y,z)=(x,z), &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
F<sub>side</sub>(x,y,z)=(y,z);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F<sub>top</sub>(x,y,z)=(x,y)
</var> 
</p><p>
Applied to the house object, we get three views. 
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER">MAPLE generated elevations.
</p><p>

</p><p>In oblique projection, which is also called <i>Cavalier projection,</i> the front view is
undistorted, but the sections of the object corresponding to <var>y = y<sub>0</sub></var> constant
are drawn up and to the right depending on how far back <var>y<sub>0</sub></var> is. If we write
<var><b>w</b>=<big>(</big>2<sup>-1/2</sup>, 2<sup>-1/2</sup><big>)</big><sup>T</sup></var>, the unit vector in
the plane at <var>45°</var>, then we may write 
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>The vectors have been written in column form to here to facilitate matrix multiplication, but
we'll not fuss about whether a vector is a row or column and use both forms interchangeably. Note
that since <var><b>w</b></var> is a unit vector, lengths in the <var>y</var> directions are mapped
to equal lengths along the <var>45°</var> line in the drawing. Indeed, putting
<var>c = 2<sup>-1/2</sup></var>, 

</p><div align="left" class="style1">
<var>dist((x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>),(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>)) 
= |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>0</sub>|;
<br> 
dist(F(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>),F(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub>))
<br>
 = dist((x<sub>0</sub> + c y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>0</sub> + c
y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>0</sub> + c y<sub>0</sub>,z<sub>0</sub> + c y<sub>0</sub>))
<br> =
<big>{</big>(c y<sub>1</sub> - c y<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (c y<sub>1</sub> - c
y<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup><big>}</big><sup>1/2</sup> = |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>0</sub>|. </var>
</div>

Of course horizontal and vertical lines also preserve measurement. There is nothing special
about <var>45°</var> except that it is common. One can find drafting paper that has
horizontal, vertical and <var>45°</var> lines used to make oblique projections. Any unit
vector <var><b>w</b></var> will do as well.

<p>Let <var>R</var> denote a rotation in the plane which moves points <var>(x,y)</var> about the
origin an angle <var>h<sub>0</sub></var>. If a vector is written in polar coordinates <var>(x,y)=(r
cos h,r sin h)</var> where <var>r={x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup></var> is the
distance of the point to the origin and <var>h</var> is the angle from the positive
<var>x</var>-axis, <var>dist((0,0),(x,y)),</var> and <var>h</var> is the angle, then using
trigonometric identities the rotated point

has the same distance from the origin and a new angle
<var>h+h<sub>0</sub></var>. Bob Palais has a nice way of seeing this&nbsp; [PR 
<a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/bob/Rotation/Rotation.html">
<tt>http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/bob/Rotation/Rotation.html</tt></a>] 
and we present a modification of his approach. Without knowing that sines and
cosines are involved, it's possible to write down the rotation transformation just knowing what
vectors are rotated into. For example, if we are given a vector <var>(a,b)</var> and wish to rotate
it into the vector <var>(0,r)</var>, then we know that
<var>r={a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup></var> is the length of the vector, and the angle
of rotation has to be <var>h<sub>0</sub></var> where <var>sin h<sub>0</sub>=a/r</var> and <var>cos
h<sub>0</sub> = b/r</var>. Thus 
<p>

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Mathematics of Perspective Drawing_files/p8h.gif" align="MIDDLE" width="365" height="51" alt="Rotation equation.">
</p><p>

</p><p>Hence <var>R(a,b)=(0,r)</var> as desired. 
</p><p>

</p><p>A variant of oblique projection is called <i>military projection.</i> In this case the
horizontal sections are isometrically drawn so that the floor plans are not distorted and the
verticals are drawn at an angle. The military projection is given by rotation in the
<var>x</var>-<var>y</var> plane and a vertical translation an amount <var>z</var>. Thus 
</p><p>
</p><p align="CENTER"><var>F<sub>military</sub>(x,y,z) = ( c x - s y, s x + c y + z). 
 </var> 
</p><p>We
chose <var>h<sub>0</sub>=-53.1°</var> so that <var>c=0.6</var> and <var>s=-0.8</var>. Note
that the floorplan is drawn rotated but without distortion.

</p><p>The isometric projections are that class or parallel projections for which a round sphere
projects to a round circle. The most common case is when measurements along the <var>x</var>-axis
are plotted at <var>30°</var>, those along the <var>y</var> axis at
<var>+150°</var> and the vertical axis. Thus if
<var><b>w</b><sub>1</sub>=(3<sup>1/2</sup>/2,1/2)</var>,
<var><b>w</b><sub>2</sub>=(-3<sup>1/2</sup>/2,1/2)</var> and <var><b>w</b><sub>3</sub>=(0,1)</var>
are unit vectors at <var>-30°</var>, <var>+30°</var> and <var>90°</var>
(vertical), the isometric projection is

<p>We now describe the perspective transformation. It is the composition of a rigid motion followed
by the perspective transformation that reduces distant objects. The rigid motion moves the object
in front of the drawing plane in such a way that the eye point <var>ep=(x<sub>e</sub>,
y<sub>e</sub>, z<sub>e</sub>)</var> is moved to the origin, so that the vector from eyepoint to
centerpoint <var>cp=(x<sub>c</sub>, y<sub>c</sub>,z<sub>c</sub>)</var> toward which the eye is
looking is moved to the positive <var>y</var>-axis and so that the vertical line through the
centerpoint is drawn vertical. We shall accomplish the rigid motion by first translating the object
to move the eyepoint to the origin using 
</p><p> 
 </p><p align="CENTER"><var>T(x,y,z)=(x - x<sub>e</sub>,
y - y<sub>e</sub>, z - z<sub>e</sub>). 
</var> 
</p><p>
Let the new vector eye to center be the
displacement <var>dp:=T(cp)</var>. Then we rotate the object around the origin. Every rotation is
the composition of a rotation around the <var>z</var>-axis by an angle <var>h</var>, around the new
<var>x</var>-axis by an angle <var>k</var> and around the <var>y</var>-axis by an angle
<var>l</var>. The three angles <var>h</var>, <var>k</var>, <var>k</var> are called the <i>Euler
angles.</i> We only need the first two rotations, and we can compute the cosines and sines involved
using only the eyepoint and centerpoint coordinates. First we rotate <var>dp</var> around the
<var>z</var>-axis so that <var>(dp<sub>1</sub>, dp<sub>2</sub>)</var> moves to <var>(0,
r<sub>1</sub>)</var> where
<br>
 <var>r<sub>1</sub> = {dp<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
dp<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup></var>. Letting <var>s<sub>1</sub> =
dp<sub>1</sub>/r<sub>1</sub></var>, <var>c<sub>1</sub> = dp<sub>2</sub>/r<sub>1</sub></var> then
the rotation is as before 
</p><p> 
 </p><p align="CENTER"><var>R( x, y, z) = (c<sub>1</sub> x - s<sub>1</sub> y,
s<sub>1</sub> x + c<sub>1 </sub>y, z). 
</var> 
</p><p>
Let <var>rdp= R(dp)=(0, rdp<sub>2</sub>,
rdp<sub>3</sub>)</var> be the rotated <var>dp</var>. The length of <var>rdp</var> is the same as
the length of <var>dp</var> which is <var>r<sub>2</sub> = {dp<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> +
dp<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + dp<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup> =
{rdp<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + rdp<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>}<sup>1/2</sup></var>. The second
rotation takes <var>rdp</var> to <var>(0, r<sub>2</sub>, 0)</var>. Setting <var>c<sub>2</sub> =
rdp<sub>2</sub>/r<sub>2</sub></var>, <var>s<sub>2</sub> = rdp<sub>3</sub>/r<sub>2</sub></var>, the
rotation around the <var>x</var>-axis becomes

</p><p>Because light reflecting off the object travels in straight lines, the object point is seen on
the drawing plane at the point where the line from the eyepoint to the object point intersects the
drawing plane. The perspective transformation is simply to deduce the coordinates <var>(u,v)</var>
on the drawing plane, which is a distance <var>d</var> from the origin, from the point
<var>X=(x,y,z)</var> using triangles. The triangles <var>(0,0):(0,d):(u,d)</var> and
<var>(0,0):(0,y):(x,y)</var> in the <i>x-y-</i>plane and the triangles
<var>(0,0):(d,0):(d,v)</var> and <var>(0,0):(y,0):(y,z)</var> in the

</p><p>Perspective transformations have the property that parallel lines on the object are mapped to
pencils of lines passing through a fixed point in the drawing plane. To see this, note that each
line in the rotated object lies in the plane passing through the line and through the eyepoint.
This plane intersects the drawing plane in a line hence the image of a line in space is a line in
the drawing. Any parallel lines in the object are parallel to the drawing plane or not. If the
lines are parallel to the drawing plane (the <var>y</var>-coordinates on the line are constant)
then the division by the depth (the <var>y</var> coordinate of the rotated object) is division by
constant. Thus the formula reduces to a constant multiple of the numerator which is an affine
transformation that maps parallel lines to parallel lines. If the parallel lines are not parallel
with the drawing plane, then their image on the drawing plane passes through a fixed point, called
the <i>vanishing point.</i> The easiest way to see this is to consider a pair of points on two
parallel lines that travel together away from the drawing plane. Imagine that a wire of fixed
length connects the points. Because the pair can get farther and farther from the drawing plane
without letting go the wire, their perspective images get closer and closer in the drawing since
the denominators are getting large whereas the difference in their <var>(x,z)</var> directions are
bounded. Imagine the cliché of two rails of a track converging at infinity. 
</p><p>

</p><p>For general choices of the eyepoint and centerpoint, the parallel lines originally in the
<var>x</var>, <var>y</var> and <var>z</var>-axis directions are not rotated to a position parallel
to the drawing plane. Thus these three directions each have their own vanishing points. This is
called <em>three-point perspective.</em> The three points may not so easily seen since they may not
be within the cone of vision that limits the width of our view. To illustrate one and two point
perspective we change our eye and center points to guarantee some parallel lines parallel to the
drawing plane.

<p>Let us consider specific choices of eyepoint and centerpoint for which some of the objects axes
are parallel to the drawing plane. Let the eyepoint <var>ep=[6.0,-15.0,2.0]</var> and the
centerpoint <var>cp=[6.0,5.0,2.0]</var>. Because <var>dp=[0,20,0]</var> no rotation is necessary.
The <var>x</var> and <var>z</var>-axes are parallel to the <var>y=1</var> plane. The perpendicular

corresponding to the <var>y</var>-axis direction. The vanishing point is indicated (it is the

This time <var>dp=[-10,20,0]</var> so that the only rotation is about the <var>z</var> axis. The

<p>The maximum view that the eye can take in is a cone of about <var>30°</var> about its
axis (the <i>cone of vision.</i>) It is possible for the computer to plot points outside the cone
of vision, but such a drawing has a distortion like a fisheye camera photo. Thus usually both
vanishing points aren't visible in the same scene, as in this computer-generated view of a cube
with parallel lines.

</p><p>How do we locate the vanishing points in the drawing? The vanishing points for the
<var>x</var>-axis and <var>y</var> axis parallels are always on the horizon line. If <var>d</var>
is the distance from eye to drawing, then the two vanishing points in the drawing for
<var>x</var>-axis and <var>y</var>-axis lines are on lines which meet at the eyepoint at

</p><p>How do we measure distances in the receding direction? The idea is to figure out sets of
parallel lines which transfer measurements along the baseline, a line parallel to the drawing
plane, to the receding line. The projective transformation may scale but not distort distances
along the baseline. To see how this works, consider the top view of a <var>3 x 3</var>
square.

equally spaced points <var>d'</var>, <var>e'</var> <var>f'</var> in the perspective drawing.

from <var>a'</var>-<var>f'</var>. If one is using two-point perspective, these are truly vertical
in the <var>u-v-</var>plane. Otherwise you have to use the vanishing point corresponding
to the vertical family (which is probably way below the picture.)

Circle</a> </h2>

<p>One is taught in drawing class, that circular objects in three-dimensional Euclidean Space are
drawn in perspective as ellipses. The usual construction is to draw a square around the circle, and
then project the perspective view of the square by finding its edges using the vanishing points and
measuring points, the center by drawing the diagonals, and then sketching the projected circle by
drawing it tangent to the projected square. A beginner will sometimes make the mistake of trying to
make the tangency points the same as the endpoints of the axes of the ellipse, but they are not the
same as seen in the p.&nbsp; 17 figure. But why is the image exactly the ellipse and not some other
closed curve? 
</p><p>

</p><p>We shall answer this question by figuring out the equation of the image of the circle on the
perspective drawing. We'll be using the methods of analytic geometry, where curves are represented
by equations. Thus we shall describe a circle in three space by describing it as the locus of
points satisfying certain equations. We then compute the corresponding perspective locus in terms
of the Cartesian coordinates of the drawing plane. Finally, after some simplification, we will be

</p><p>The conic sections in the plane are given as the locus, that is the set of all points
<var>(u,v)</var> in <var><b>E</b><sup>2</sup></var> which satisfy a quadratic equation of the form
</p><p>(1.)
</p><p align="CENTER"><var>au<sup>2</sup> + 2buv + cv<sup>2</sup> + eu + fv + g = 0, </var>
</p><p>
where <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, <var>d</var>, <var>e</var>, <var>f</var>,
<var>g</var> are constants. This can be deduced from the geometric description of the conic section
as the intersection in three space of a plane with a right circular cone. All possible conic
sections arise this way including degenerate ones such as lines and points and the empty set. For
example if <var>a=b=c=0</var> then 
</p><p align="CENTER"><var>e u + f v + g = 0

is satisfied only
by one point <var>(u,v)=(u<sub>0</sub>,v<sub>0</sub>)</var> whereas 
</p><p align="CENTER">
<var>u<sup>2</sup> + v<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0 
</var> 
</p><p>has no real solution at all. On
the other hand if the discriminant 
</p><p align="CENTER"><var>D = a c - b<sup>2</sup> 
</var>
</p><p>is negative, then the conic is a hyperbola, if <var>D=0</var> the conic is a parabola and if
<var>D</var> is positive the conic is an ellipse. The easiest to see are the canonical 
conic curves given by
the formulae

</p><p>Of course if <var>a=b</var> the ellipse is a circle.

</p><p>Now let's see what a projective transformation looks like analytically. For simplicity, we
assume that the set is located in front of the observer (all points of the circle satisfy
<var>y0</var>.) Then the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the drawing plane (points which
satisfy <var>y=1</var>) are

consider a circle in space with center <var>(x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>)</var> and
radius <var>r</var> and which lies on a plane not parallel to the drawing plane. By a rotation
around the <var>y</var>-axis, we may arrange that the intersection line of the circle plane and the
drawing plane is horizontal. In other words, the equation of the plane through the center of the
circle sloping away from the drawing plane with slope <var>m</var> is given by

</p><p align="CENTER"><var>z - z<sub>0</sub> = m (y - y<sub>0</sub>).

</p><p>To be
able to see the circle, we require that the eyepoint <var>(0, 0, 0)</var> is not on the plane of
the circle, which means <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> does not equal <var>m y<sub>0</sub> </var>. The
circle also lies on the sphere of radius <var>r </var>centered at <var>(x<sub>0</sub>,

</p><p>We are trying to see how these equations
relate <var>u</var> to <var>v</var>. Using (2.), we substitute in the equations (3.) and (5.)

Substituting into equation (5.) and multiplying by <var>(v - m)<sup>2</sup></var> yields

Since the eyepoint is not on the plane of the circle <var>z<sub>0</sub> - m y<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0.</var>
 Since the circle is in front of the <var>y=0</var> plane, the point
<var>(x<sub>0</sub>, 0, z<sub>0</sub> + m y<sub>0</sub>)</var> which is both in the <var>y=0</var>

any point of the circle, hence

<p>The original impetus to projective geometry came from perspective drawing. Alberti's textbook
<i>Della Pittura</i> (1435) formulated new questions that tempted mathematicians to study new
questions beyond those addressed by the Greeks. If two artists make perspective drawings of the
same object, their drawings will not be the same, for example because different parts of the object
will be closer to each of the the two artists. But what properties of the drawings remain the same?
(<a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm#AlbertiQ">Diagram of Alberti's question.</a>) 
</p><p>

</p><p>The perspective projection, which takes points <var>X</var> of the object which are in three
space and plots them as points <var>P</var> on the drawing plane. Let us write this 
</p><p align="CENTER"><var>P=f(X). 
</var> 
</p><p>
It has the property that points are mapped to points and
lines to lines. However, parallel lines in three space which are not parallel to the drawing plane
must be drawn to converge at their vanishing points. Thus the correspondence between lines and
points in three space and lines and points on the drawing isn't perfect. Thus if
<var>L<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>L<sub>2</sub></var> are parallel lines in three space then
<var>f(L<sub>1</sub>)</var> and <var>f(L<sub>1</sub>)</var> are lines which intersect at
<var>V</var> their vanishing point. However <var>L<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>L<sub>2</sub></var>
don't intersect at any point. In the diagram, lines <var>AB, CD</var> and <var>E'V'</var> are
parallel. Their projections <var>A'B', C'D'</var> intersect at a point <var>V'</var> which is
called the <i>vanishing point</i> since it has no corresponding point in three space. 
</p><p>

</p><p>The solution was proposed by Girard Desargues (1591-1661) a self educated man who worked as an
architect after leaving the army. His opus with the ponderous name, <i>Broullion project d`une atteinte
aux événemens des renconteres du cône avec un plan,</i> (1693) which describes
projective methods in geometry went unnoticed. Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867), an engineer in
Napoleon's army reworked the theory in <i>Traité des proprietiés projectives des
Figures</i>(1822) while a prisoner of war in Russia in 1813 [KF]. This elevated Desargues work in projective
geometry to one of the success stories of synthetic geometry, whose merits versus analytic geometry
were being debated at the time.
 We sketch two theorems from projective geometry. For a more rigorous treatment, the reader should
consult any of a number of texts, such as O'Hara &amp; Ward [OW] or Wylie [WC]. </p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Mathematics of Perspective Drawing_files/ParVP.GIF" width="430" height="363" alt="Drawing of how parallel lines meet at vanishing point."> </p><p>

</p><p>To complete the correspondence, Desargues introduced ideal points, called <i>points at
infinity</i> one for each set of parallel lines. The points at infinity don't contradict any
axioms. They function as a convenience since now every pair of lines intersects at one point, the
case of parallel lines does not have to be treated as an exceptional case. The following is now
called <i>Desargues' Theorem of Homologous Triangles.</i> 

</p><p> 
<em><b>Theorem.</b> Suppose
there is a point <var>O</var> and triangles <var>ABC</var> and
<var>A'B'C'</var> in the plane or three space. If they are projectively related from the
point <var>O</var>, that is, the triples <var>{O, A, A'}</var>, <var>{O, B,
B'}</var> and <var>{O, C, C'}</var> are all collinear. Then the points of
intersections of the corresponding sides <var>AB</var> and <var>A'B'</var>,
<var>AC</var> and <var>A'C'</var> and <var>BC</var> and
<var>B'C'</var> (or their prolongations) are collinear. Conversely, if the three pairs of
corresponding sides meet in three points which lie on one straight line, then the lines joining
corresponding vertices meet at one point (are projectively related.)</em> 
</p><p>

</p><p>The proof is easier for the case that the triangles are not coplanar. See Dörrie [HD] or
Meserve [MB] for proofs.

</p><p>

</p><p>To see how we may use projective geometry directly to argue that the perspective image of a
circle is an ellipse, we use a theorem due to Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Pascal, who was urged to
investigate the relationship between projectivities and conics by Desargues, published his <i>Essai
sur les Coniques</i> when he was sixteen. Although he didn't prove the converse part, the theorem
is known as <i>Pascal's Hexagon Theorem.</i> 

</p><p> <em> <b>Theorem.</b> Let a hexagon be
inscribed in a (nonsingular point-) conic. Then the three points of intersection of pairs of
opposite sides are collinear. Conversely, if the opposite sides of a hexagon, (of which no three
vertices lie on a straight line) intersect on a straight line, the six vertices lie on a
non-singular point-conic.

</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER">Diagram for Pascal's Hexagon Theorem.
</p><p>
Pascal's Theorem may be used to deduce that the perspective image of a circle is an ellipse.
Thus if <var>c</var> is the circle and <var>f(c)</var> is its image in a perspective drawing
relative to the eyepoint <var>O</var>, then we have to show that if any six points <var>A, B, C, D,
E, F</var> are chosen on <var>f(c)</var> so that no three of them lie on a straight line then the
pairs of opposite sides intersect in collinear points. Then by the converse of Pascal's Theorem,
the six points lie on a nonsingular point-conic. But since five points determine a conic, the sixth
point which may be any general point of <var>f(c)</var> must be on the same on the conic. It
follows that no matter which six points are chosen, they lie on the same conic, thus
<var>f(C)</var> is (part of) a single point-conic. One argues that <var>f(c)</var> is bounded and
nondegenerate thus can only be the ellipse. But the six points are in perspective correspondence to
points <var>A', B', C', D', E', F'</var> on <var>c</var> which is a circle, hence a point-conic.
Therefore, by Pascal's Theorem, the pairs of opposite sides (<var>A'B'</var> and <var>E'D'</var>),
(<var>B'C'</var> and <var>F'E'</var>), and (<var>C'D'</var> and <var>A'F'</var>) intersect at
points <var>P', Q', R'</var> respectively, which are collinear in the plane of <var>c</var>. Their
perspective images <var>P, Q, R</var> in the plane of <var>F(c)</var> must also be collinear since
the perspective image of a line not containing <var>O</var> is a line. Moreover the planes
<var>OA'B', OE'D'</var> contain the edges <var>AB, ED</var>, resp., since they are perspective to
each other, and thus the planes intersect along the line <var>OP'P</var>. In other words, the point
<var>P</var> is the intersection of the edges <var>AB</var> and <var>ED</var>. Similarly
<var>Q</var> is the intersection of the edges <var>BC</var> and <var>FE</var> and <var>R</var> is
the intersection of the edges <var>CD</var> and <var>BF</var>. Thus <var>P, Q, R</var> are
collinear and we are done.

<p>Without going very deep into computer science complications, we explain something about the
mathematics behind computer drawing. Computer science issues are treated, <i>e.g.</i> in [PP]. One
of the ways that a computer renders three-dimensional object is to build up the image from little
constituent pieces. The object is regarded as a collection of polygons. The visual position of each
little piece is computed and the polygons are drawn one polygon at a time. The computer screen is
given a Cartesian (horizontal and vertical axis) coordinate system and the polygon is drawn
specifying the position of each <var>P=(u,v)</var> of its vertices. For example, as the three
triangles red <var>(0,0),(4,-1),(1,.5)</var>, green <var>(4,2),(1,-.5),(4,1)</var> and
blue<var>(4,-2),(3,1.5),(3,-1.5)</var> are drawn, each one covers the previous ones. 
</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Mathematics of Perspective Drawing_files/Trians.gif" width="467" height="219" alt="Triangle plotting animation.">
</p><p>

</p><p>If for example, we wish to draw the front elevation of the an object in space consisting of the
three triangles <var>[(0,1,0),(4,0,-1),(1,1,.5)]</var>, <var>[(4,1,2),(1,0,-.5),(4,1,1)]</var> and
<var>[(4,1,-2),(3,0,1.5),(3,1,-1.5)]</var> viewed toward the <var>+y</var>-axis, we have to draw
the triangles as before, because the projection is given by 
</p><p> 
</p><p align="CENTER"><var>F(x, y,z )=(x, z).</var>
</p><p> 
 </p><p>
This would result in an incorrect
picture because one of tips of each triangle is closer to the viewer than some one of the other
triangles. <i>e.g.</i>, the base of the first triangle <var>(0,1,0),(1,1,.5)</var> at
<var>y=1</var> is farther from the viewer than the remaining vertex <var>(4,0,-1)</var> at
<var>y=0</var>. Another source of error would be if polygons in the object actually intersected. To
correctly render the front elevation, the triangles have to be subdivided further into parts and
the parts in front have to be drawn on top of parts in back. 
</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER">
<img src="./Mathematics of Perspective Drawing_files/Overlap.GIF" width="471" height="219" alt="Overlapping triangles.">
</p><p>

</p><p>The most fundamental way to depict depth in a picture is overlapping closer objects over farther
ones. In general it is quite involved to decide if some part of the object can be seen or not. The
simple way to deal with this is to draw all polygons of the object back to front. Some of the
polygons which are in back of the object eventually get completely covered up. This is called the
<i>painter's algorithm.</i> The way it works in our MAPLE program, first we compute the distances
of each point to the eye. Then a typical distance is given for each polygon, which in our case is
the distance to the nearest point. Then the polygons are sorted according to their typical
distances, and are rendered back to front. Our program does not try to account for complicated
overlaps or intersections so will sometimes render objects incorrectly. To illustrate the painter's
algorithm, suppose we render a cube. The faces are drawn back to front, depending on the distance
of each side to the viewer. In the example, the sky being farthest is drawn first, followed by the
earth, the back face, the base, the sides, the top and finally the front, eventually covering up
all but two sides. 
</p><p>

</p><p align="CENTER"><img src="./Mathematics of Perspective Drawing_files/Painter.gif" width="301" height="300" alt="Animation of painter&#39;s algorithm.">
</p><p>

</p><p>Another way of rendering a three-dimensional object is called <i>ray tracing.</i> In ray
tracing, the computer follows light rays back from the eye to a point on the object from where it
figures out how intense the light is and what its color is by following back the rays which
illuminate that point. This can continue for several stages. At each stage the computation accounts
for surface properties like shine and color and body properties such as refractive index and
transmittivity. An example of ray tracing is a rendering of the same house made by the program

<a href="http://www.povray.org/">
<i>POV-Ray<sup>TM</sup></i></a><i> (Persistence of Vision<sup>TM</sup> Ray-Tracer Version 3.1.)</i> We have
specified that the body be made of gray glass and be positioned on a chessboard.

<li>Design an object to test MAPLE's <var>3d</var> capability. Be sure that your object doesn't
